# Mock Sales Analysis

### TLDR;
This is just a simple mock sales visualization done on Tableau.

I've never used any BI/visualization tools outside of Excel so I decided to create a mockdata set using [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/), and proceed with trying to create a simple sales analysis dashboard. The link to the dashboard can be found below⬇️ or in the description panel to the right➡️.

### Setup
[Simply go to my Tablue Public profile to interact with the dashbord](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stefano.s1845/viz/MockSalesAnalysis/MockSalesAnalysis).

---

### Dataset
The dataset is very basic as I wanted to have easy variables to work with when familiarizing myself with the tool.

### Challenges
The ‘challenges’ I mostly faced was not remembering the built-in functionality of Tableau. I would try to clean and do any mathematics outside of Tableau, only to realize that there’s already tools there to service my needs.
I originally tried to connect another dataset to the visualization and create a relationship between the two, but I couldn’t think of a good addition.
